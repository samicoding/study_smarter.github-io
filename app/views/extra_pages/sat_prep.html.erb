  <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> What is the SAT? </h1>
    <ul class="servicePar2">The SAT Reasoning Test consists of four multiple choice sections (Critical Reading, Writing and Language, Math without Calculator, Math with Calculator) and one optional essay section. Though many schools do not require the SAT essay, we generally recommend that students prepare for and take the essay section in order to provide maximum flexibility during the college admissions process. </ul>
  <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Test Dates </h1>
    <ul class="servicePar2">The SAT will be administered seven times during the 2016-2017 school year: once each in October, November, December, January, March, May, and June. For testing dates in October, January, and May, families can purchase a detailed score report and a copy of the test taken. As we generally consider more information to be better than less, we encourage our students to order this "Question and Answer Service" when available. This service can be ordered during test registration or up to five months after the testing date.</ul>
      <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> What is the ACT?</h1>
        <ul class="servicePar2">The ACT consists of four multiple choice sections (English, Math, Reading, Science) and one optional essay section. Again, though many schools do not require the ACT essay, we generally recommend that students prepare for and take the essay section in order to provide maximum flexibility during the college admissions process.</ul>
      <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Test Dates</h1>
        <ul class="servicePar2">The ACT will be administered six times during the 2016-2017 school year: once each in September, October, December, February, April, and June. For testing dates in December, April, and June, families can purchase a detailed score report and a copy of the test taken. As we generally consider more information to be better than less, we encourage our students to order this "Test Information Release" when available. This service can be ordered during registration or up to three months after the testing date.</ul>
        <ul class="servicePar2">Many variables are involved in crafting effective programs for different students. Please call us for an initial consultation.</ul>
