  <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> SAT Subject Test Prep</h1>
    <ul class="servicePar2">Colleges vary in their requirements for SAT Subject Tests: some colleges do not require any subject tests, while others may require up to three. Families should consider which colleges their students might wish to attend to get a sense of whether subject tests are necessary. We have provided a link to the SAT's list of schools that use SAT Subject Tests; however, the best way to get the most reliable and current information is to contact colleges directly.</ul>
    <ul class="servicePar2">If a student does decide to take SAT Subject Tests, we can provide a consultation about which tests and which test dates might be best. We have developed our own curricula for the Math 2, Chemistry, US History, and Literature tests, and can provide support for many of the other subject tests as well. Please contact us for more information.</ul>
  <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Rates </h1>
    <ul class="servicePar2"> SAT Subject Test Preparation is available for $125-$150 per hour, depending on the location of tutoring and which test a student plans to take. The number of necessary tutoring hours for a student will vary based on many factors, including motivation, starting scores, and goals. Please call us to discuss a program that will fit your student's needs.</ul>
