  <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> SAT & ACT Prep</h1>
    <ul class="servicePar2">For both the SAT and the ACT, we offer preparation that combines knowledgeable and supportive instructors, our specialized curriculum, and the most comprehensive practice-feedback system available. We primarily use instructional materials that have been developed in-house, the results of thousands of hours of study and analysis of testing materials. We do not subscribe to the philosophy of one-size-fits-all testing tricks; instead, we work with individual students to identify strategies that will work for them. The last phase of preparation usually involves students taking previously administered, full-length practice tests and then reviewing those tests in detail with a tutor. We offer a proctored testing environment on many weekends in order to simulate the experience of a real test. We also provide proctoring guidelines and personalized guidance for families to create test environments at home.</ul>
    <ul class="servicePar2">We hire our Test Prep coaches as full-time employees—a rarity in the tutoring world—in order to ensure that they are masters of their craft. Because we want to provide only the highest quality instruction, it is not unusual for us to conduct several dozen interviews before filling a position, carefully selecting tutors based on academic excellence, personality, and dedication to the academic and personal growth of students. New tutors undergo an average of 100 hours of initial training, and ongoing mentorship from our most experienced tutors ensures that we offer every student a personalized, strategic path to his or her goal. Such rigorous training requires a good deal of resources on our part, but we believe it is our responsibility to ensure that our students receive the best instruction, mentorship, and support available. Our tutors also have experience coaching students with IEPs and students who receive testing accommodations at school.</ul>
    <ul class="servicePar2">Many variables are involved in crafting effective programs for different students. Please call us for an initial consultation.</ul>
    <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Which test is Best?</h1>
      <ul class="servicePar2">The vast majority of colleges now accept both the SAT and the ACT for admission, and there is no obvious trend that might indicate which students will perform better on which tests. Therefore, diagnostic tests are the most helpful tools in order to determine which test is better for a given student. We can provide and grade a previously administered SAT and/or ACT for diagnostic purposes. We then work with families to decide which test might be best. If a student wishes to take both tests officially, the SAT and ACT dates do not conflict, even if they are offered in the same month. Please contact us for additional information about choosing a test.</ul>
      <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Preliminary Tests</h1>
        <ul class="servicePar2">Most high school students will take the PSAT/NMSQT (the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test) during the October of their junior years through their schools. Some students may also choose to take the PSAT 10 in the spring of sophomore year. PSAT scores provide a projected estimate of a student's likely SAT scores. Some schools may also offer the ACT Plan test—a diagnostic version of the ACT—to tenth grade students, though this exam is currently being phased out.</ul>
        <ul class="servicePar2">We can provide tutoring and coaching for the PSAT; however, as it is a diagnostic test for the full-length SAT, students will generally also be preparing for the SAT or the ACT in tandem. Students preparing for the ACT will not be at a disadvantage if they wish to take the PSAT, as there is a high degree of material crossover between the two. Our tutors can provide coaching on the few strategic differences that do exist.</ul>
        <h1 class="serviceTitle2"> Rates </h1>
          <ul class="servicePar2"> SAT and ACT Test Preparation is available for $125-$150 per hour, depending on the location of tutoring and which test a student plans to take. The number of necessary tutoring hours for a student will vary based on many factors, including motivation, starting scores, and goals. Please call us to discuss a program that will fit your student's needs.</ul>
